This is a demo for how to use SmartContract with Azure BlockChain App Builder. There are two demos:
 - Sava ChatBot conversation data into BlockChan ( I know it's not a good practices, but it's fun :) )
 - Save IoT Data into BlockChain and setting the telemetry value threadhold that will trigger event. It's a modified version of orignal sample. Add IoT Device support. 

We use Ethereum here.
